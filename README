WLCREATOR

By Jonathan Heinz

wlcreator is a custom wordlist/dictionary creator designed for use in brute force programs.

It is intended to be used when you know certain properties of a password, and don't want to waste time
checking every password in a large dictionary.

wlcreator can be used to create custom dictionaries based on certain criteria. Currently, the active
filters are:

--chars-only: creates a wordlist with character-based passwords.
--nums-only: creates a wordlist with number-based passwords.
--length [length]: Creates a wordlist with only passwords of a certain length.
--min-length [length]: Creates a wordlist with a minimum length.
--max-length [length]: Creates a wordlist with a maximum length.
