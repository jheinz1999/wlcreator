WLCREATOR

By Jonathan Heinz

wlcreator is a custom wordlist/dictionary creator designed for use in brute force programs.

It is intended to be used when you know certain properties of a password, and don't want to waste time
checking every password in a large dictionary.

wlcreator can be used to create custom dictionaries based on certain criteria. Currently, the active
filters are:

--chars-only: creates a wordlist with character-based passwords.

--nums-only: creates a wordlist with number-based passwords.

--lower-only: Creates a wordlist with lowercase passwords.

--upper-only: Creates a wordlist with uppercase passwords.

--length [length]: Creates a wordlist with only passwords of a certain length.

--min-length [length]: Creates a wordlist with a minimum length.

--max-length [length]: Creates a wordlist with a maximum length.

--password [password]: Creates a password based on the password provided. This is useful if you know specific
things about the password, such as what character comes first. Passwords are entered by typing the characters
you know followed by asterisks. For example, if you knew that the password was 8 characters long, and that the
first four characters were "love", you'd type:

wlcreator --password love****
